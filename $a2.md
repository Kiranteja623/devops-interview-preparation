* K8S RBAC:
------------
```
Role-based access control (RBAC) is an important security feature in Kubernetes that allows administrators to manage and control access to the cluster and its resources. RBAC allows administrators to define who can perform specific actions on specific resources within a cluster.

Here are the steps to set up RBAC in a Kubernetes cluster:

1.Define roles: Roles are sets of permissions that can be assigned to users or service accounts. Roles can be defined for different namespaces in a cluster, or for the entire cluster.
2.Define role bindings: Role bindings associate a role with a user or service account. Role bindings can be defined for different namespaces in a cluster, or for the entire cluster.
3.Assign roles to users and service accounts: Once roles have been defined and role bindings have been created, administrators can assign roles to users and service accounts. This can be done using the Kubernetes API or through the use of kubectl.
4.Validate RBAC rules: After RBAC rules have been defined and role bindings have been created, administrators can validate the RBAC rules by attempting to perform actions with a user or service account that has been assigned a role. This can be done using the Kubernetes API or through the use of kubectl.
5.Monitor and enforce RBAC rules: Administrators should regularly monitor and enforce RBAC rules to ensure that they are functioning correctly and that users and service accounts have the correct level of access to the cluster and its resources.

* diiference between on demand and spot instances
```
1.Spot instances provide a lower cost option for developers to manage non-essential tasks on AWS platform. These instances are those you would bid on and they launch once the bid is higher than the going price based on supply and demand. There is a major drawback on spot instances, if the spot exceeds the bid price it can be terminated at any time.
• On-demand instances are created based on user need and cost by the hour. When they are no longer required, they can be released.
